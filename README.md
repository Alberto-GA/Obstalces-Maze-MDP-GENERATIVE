# Obstalces-Maze-MDP-GENERATIVE
This repository presents a new approach to solve the same problem as Obstalces-Maze-MDP. 
In this case,  the problem has been modeled from a generative perspective. In other words, 
the main program do not instantiate all the states of the problem beforehand.
This architecture is optimised to use UCT and enhanced versions of this solver.
